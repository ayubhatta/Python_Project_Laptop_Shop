# Python_Project_Laptop_Shop

It's a python project created using functions and file handling. It's about a laptop shop which purchases laptop from the manufacturer and 
sells to the customer as well. When the code is run, the code asks the user to input 1, 2, or 3. 
1 to purchase from the manufacturer.
2 to sell the laptops to the customer.
3 to exit the shop.

In this project, the user can purchase or sell laptops multiple times before printing the bill.
